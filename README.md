# NotWordle
https://p0pman20.github.io/NotWordle/

Created a repo for a old school project
- Probably won't ever touch this again
- Wordle Recreation
- Got me an A
- PWA (Add to homescreen)
- Responsive (ish) UI
- Most of app is dynamically created by modifying DOM/CSS
- Uses KeyboardEvents for the keys


### Improvements
- [ ] Congratulate user upon success
- [ ] Check word list to see if input is valid
- [ ] I should start over
- [ ] You should play a different wordle clone
